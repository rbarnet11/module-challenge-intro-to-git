## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is an open source distributed version control system.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is the software, while GitHub is the company that provides a cloud-based git hosting service.
3. Why do we create a branch?
To create a separate workspace from other team members.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
A pull request allows us to review changes/differences between branches.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
git branch -M main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
'git fetch' tells the local repository that changes have been made in the remote repository without moving anything.
'git merge' integrates independent branches into a single branch.
'git pull' brings a copy of the remote directory changes into the local repository and lets us review differences between branches.
7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict arises when Git can't automatically determine which files are correct because multiple developers are editing the same content. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
Pull the changes to the local repository and fix the conflicts there.
